[Raku uses rationals by default, so .1 is stored something like { numerator => 1, denominator => 10 }](https://docs.raku.org/type/Rational).  To actually trigger the behavior, you must force the numbers to be of type Num (double in C terms) and use the base function instead of the sprintf or fmt functions (since those functions have a bug that limits the precision of the output).
